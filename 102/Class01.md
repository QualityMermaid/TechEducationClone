## Overview Growth Mindset

### What is a Growth Mindset?

For me having a growth mindset means I and others have the ability to expand our understanding and grow though learning. This can be hard! But anyone can learn anything if you put your mind to it! Sometimes a more creative approach is needed as not everyone learns the same way.

### How can I keep myself in the Growth mindset?

- Take a break!!! One of the biggest issues I have is to put myself down thinking I cannot do this. When I get into this mindspace I need to take a break from whatever it is I am doing and do something else! Usually it's sewing related.
- Learn something new each day! Having a Son means I am learning new things all the time. Making sure I take a breather and rememeber that Life IS learning and focusing on the new thing I (or someone else) has learned that day. 
- Asking myself 'how about?/what if i do this?' other questions like these point me down other avenues to explore. There is no such thing as a dumb question!!! but there is a learning black hole (and sometimes I need to be dragged out).
