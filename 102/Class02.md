# Class 02 The Coder's Computer

We have learned how to use the terminal to create new directories (folders) and files.

This is really useful as instead of doing it the manual way which can take more time this is a quick and easy way to create them.

You can use the terminal (already installed on most OS's though can be called something different. I am on Mac so is called Terminal). You can also use the Terminal in VSCode as its built in.

For more reading and information you can look at these links:

## Q&A
1. What are four important features to look for in a text editor?
2. What do the following commands do?
   > pwd
   - print working directory
   > ls
   - list all in directory
   > cd 
   - change directory
   > mkdir
   - make directory
   > touch 
   - create file
3. Can you explain what is happening in the following scenario if these commands and arguments are entered into the command line? (Arguments are extra instructions given to a command.)
   > cd projects 
   - changes directory to the folder "changes" if your in the right directory that holds it
   > mkdir new-project 
   - make directory "new-project" in current directory
   > touch new-project/newfile.md 
   - creates a new file in the new-project directory called "newfile.md"
   > cd .. 
   - changes directory up one level
   > ls projects/new-project 
   - lists all not hidden items that are in the projects/new-project directory
