# Class 03 Revisions and the Cloud

We are using Git to keep track of the changes we are making. We have a GitHub account which stores our code 'online' and then make a Clone of it on our own PC's where we can use Git to make changes without overwriting the code stored 'online'

When our code is 'working' on our PC's we can then push changes from our remote work (Git) to the remote work on GitHub.
