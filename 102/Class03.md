# Class 03 Revisions and the Cloud

We are using Git to keep track of the changes we are making. We have a GitHub account which stores our code 'online' and then make a Clone of it on our own PC's where we can use Git to make changes without overwriting the code stored 'online'

When our code is 'working' on our PC's we can then push changes from our remote work (Git) to the remote work on GitHub. 



## Q&A
1. What is Version Control? 
> Version control is a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later. It allows you to revert selected files back to a previous state, revert the entire project back to a previous state, compare changes over time, see who last modified something that might be causing a problem, who introduced an issue and when, and more.
2. What is cloning in Git? 
> Primarily used to create a copy of an existing repository (repo) by making a clone of that repo in a new directory at another location (usually on your local machine).
3. What is the command to track and stage files?
> git status  (shows what is different)  
  git add  . (adds changes to a staging)
4. What is the command to take a snapshot of your changed files? 
> git commit -m "Why are you updating this?"
5. What is the command to send your changed files to Github? 
> git push
