## Q&A
1. What is HTML and why do we use it?
> Hypertext Markup Language, a standardized system for tagging text files to achieve font, colour, graphic, and hyperlink effects on World Wide Web pages.
"an HTML file"
2. What are the 3 main parts of an HTML element?
> The opening tag (or start tag) marks where the element’s content begins.  
The closing tag (or end tag) marks the end of the element’s content . The closing tag is identical to the opening tag with the addition of a forward slash (/) after the first angle bracket.  
The content is placed between the element’s opening and closing tags.
3. What is it called when you give an element extra information?
> An element is a part of a webpage. In XML and HTML, an element may contain a data item or a chunk of text or an image, or perhaps nothing. A typical element includes an opening tag with some attributes, enclosed text content, and a closing tag.
4. What is a semantic element?
> In programming, Semantics refers to the meaning of a piece of code — for example "what effect does running that line of JavaScript have?", or "what purpose or role does that HTML element have" (rather than "what does it look like?".)
