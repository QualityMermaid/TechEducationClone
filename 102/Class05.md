# CSS

## Notes

- create file called styles.css in main repo
- make sure to LINK the .css file and the html file
   - do this by adding "link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css" (with opening and closing tags)
   - can be created in the head by adding style element in the html file
   - added as as attribute in the element in the html file
      - useful if you wanted to change ONE different header for instance as it will take priortiy over the .css file
- .css is a cascading page and will read top to bottom
- there is a point system for which style will take priorty!!!


## syntax
- h1 (type selecter) will change style to all h1 (same for other h2, h3)
- color is a property which we can then add value eg. blue (can use font-size and loads of other different things)
- sizing can be done in different measurements! including % of a page
- '*' is a universal selecter and will select EVERYTHING (mostly)
- .XXX (class selecter) whatever has that class name will have this style attached to it
