# Loops!!!

## have done all notes on other page but here are some highlights

## Q&A
1. What is an expression in JavaScript?
> an expression is a valid unit of code that resolves to a value. There are two types of expressions: those that have side effects (such as assigning values) and those that purely evaluate.
2. Why would we use a loop in our code?
> Loops are used in JavaScript to perform repeated tasks based on a condition. Conditions typically return true or false . A loop will continue running until the defined condition returns false
3. When does a for loop stop executing?
> When the conditional value is no longer true
4. How many times will a while loop execute?
> depends on the conditions but can be forever!
