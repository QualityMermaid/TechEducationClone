## Q&A

### HTML
1. To create a basic link, we wrap text or other content inside what element?
> <a>
2. The href attribute contains what information?
> this is a Hypertext Reference or target that contains the web address (the location you want to like to)
3. What are some ways we can ensure links on our pages are accessible to all readers?
> adding supporting information with a title attribute, this makes things like screen readers give more information on what the link it to.

### CSS
1. What is meant by “normal flow”?
> The default layout for CSS elements
2. What are a few differences between block-level and inline elements?
> block-level by default the elements are laid out in the flock flow direction, each will appear in a new line.
> inline will display elements next to eachother in the same line along with any adhacent (wrapped) text.
> you can mix the two together eg inline-block.
3. ___ positioning is the default for every html element.
> Static, this is the default that every element gets. eg- put the element into its normal position in the document flow.
4. Name a few advantages to using absolute positioning on an element.
> - means the positioned element no longer exists in the normal document flow
> - sits in its own layer
> - its isolated
> - easy to create popup box
5. What is a key difference between fixed positioning and absolute positioning?
> one key difference: whereas absolute positioning fixes an element in place relative to its nearest positioned ancestor (the initial containing block if there isn't one), fixed positioning usually fixes an element in place relative to the visible portion of the viewport. 

### Layout

1.Describe the difference between a function declaration and a function invocation.
> declaring means to declare the creation of variables and functions. eg let colour;
> initialization occurs when you assign an initial value to a variable. eg. colour = "green"
2. What is the difference between a parameter and an argument?
> parameter = are the names listed in the function definition
> argument = are the real values passed to (and revieved by) the function

### Other

1. Pick 2 benefits to pair programming and reflect on how these benefits could help you on your coding journey.
> Engaged collaboration: having more than one person focused on the same code the experience is more engaging and they will be more focused!
> Learning from someone else; everyone knowns something you wont know! By pairing you will learn something new OR you will be teaching someone else something!
