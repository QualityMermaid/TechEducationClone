## Q&A

1. Explain why we need domain modeling.
> takes and tracks lots of information then outputs it into something easy to follow
2. Why should tables not be used for page layouts?
> tables reduce accessibility for visually impaired users they are also not responsive
3. List and describe 3 different semantic HTML elements used in an HTML 'table'.
> th = table header   
> tr = table row   
> td = table data
4. What is a constructor and what are some advantages to using it?
> a constructor is like a tempate of ofject literals which we can add/remove/change. it WILL effect all the objects instead of doing them all one at a time which is time consuming and error prone
5. How does the term this differ when used in an object literal versus when used in a constructor?
> In a constructor function this does not have a value. It is a substitute for the new object. The value of this will become the new object when a new object is created.
6. Explain prototypes and inheritance via an analogy from your previous work experience.   
NOTE: This is a very common front end developer interview question
> I will be using this in the lab and will hopefully learn more!
