## Q&A
1. Name some key differences between a Syntax Error and a Logic Error.
> - Syntax Error is when you have made a spelling mistake or are missing a piece of syntax for your code to run.
> - Logic error is when the code isn't doing what you expect it to eg it runs but gives you the wrong result. These are usually harder to find as your console or other tools are unlikely to through up and error or warning.
2. List a few types of errors that you have encountered in past lab assignments and explain how you were able to correct them.
> missing all or part of []{}(). by making sure my code is correctly indented i can see more clearly where my opening and closing tags are.
> spelling mistakes missing off letters, using search function to find what im missing
> not declaring a varible in the right place
3. How will this topic continue to influence your long term goals?
> Error handling is a natural part of development. understanding more about the types and what they mean will greatly help me in the future
4. How would you describe the JavaScript Debugger tool and how it works to someone just starting out in software development?
> The tool is built into browsers to aid in troubleshooting. You can access by inspecting any webpage and looking at the source tab.
5. Define what a breakpoint is.
> a breakpoint is something you put in like a pause putton when you want to pause what your code is doing. this is useful when stepping though your code to find the bit that isn't working as expected. you can also then make changes and continue the run. after it will run again and stop in the same place if your changes have not helped.
6. What is the call stack?
> the callstack lists what functions and code has been execited to the current line of code. it can help with code cleanup as will list functions run.
## Notes
After working for 10+ years as a Tester/Quality Engineer it nice to get a better understanding of WHAT is going wrong.... and Where. even when its not totally clear im able to go though and add things to help understand what is happening
