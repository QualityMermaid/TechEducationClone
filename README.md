# Introduction

***Hello*** my name is Jessica! Feel free to call me Jess/Jessica I do not mind which and my pronouns are she/her.
I have over 10 years of Quality/Testing experience working with embedded devices as well as web so learning how to create code from 'the other side' is very exciting!
I am dyslixic so please let me know if there are any spelling mistakes on here and I will attempt to correct them!!!!

When I am not at work you will find me:
- With my Son (he is currently 2), Husband (SW Engineer so useful to have around during this course) and Cat (not so useful to have on the course)
- Playing Video Games and/or Boardgames (Currently Zelda Tears of the Kingdom)
- Sewing! I have currently gotten into bag making
