## Growth Mindset  

### What is a Growth Mindset?

For me having a growth mindset means I and others have the ability to expand our understanding and grow though learning. This can be hard! But anyone can learn anything if you put your mind to it! Sometimes a more creative approach is needed as not everyone learns the same way.

### How can I keep myself in the Growth mindset?

- Take a break!!! One of the biggest issues I have is to put myself down thinking I cannot do this. When I get into this mindspace I need to take a break from whatever it is I am doing and do something else! Usually it's sewing related.
- Learn something new each day! Having a Son means I am learning new things all the time. Making sure I take a breather and rememeber that Life IS learning and focusing on the new thing I (or someone else) has learned that day. 
- Asking myself 'how about?/what if i do this?' other questions like these point me down other avenues to explore. There is no such thing as a dumb question!!! but there is a learning black hole (and sometimes I need to be dragged out).

## Useful information during course
Here is a list on commands and other cheats we learned and I can access easily here using this page as a 'cheat sheet'

### Terminology 
- acp (access commit push)

### Terminal
- pwd (print working directory, tells me where I am currently)
- ls (list, lists what files are currently in the location and not hidden)
- ls -a (shows hidden files)
- command+k (clears terminal) or clear
- cd (change directory, cd TechEd/)
  - cd TechEd/ (takes to TechEd/ file from current directory if it is there)
  - cd (without anything else will take back to root directory)
  - cd .. (go up one directory)
- tab autocompletes (eg type pict then tab to cd into Pictures)
- mkdir (make directory)
  - mkdir hello (creates file called hello)
- rmdir (remove directory)
  - rmdir hello (removes file hello)
- touch (creates new file from the terminal) 
  - touch hello.dm
- code . (launches vscode)
- git clone (will clone reposertry from github)
  - git clone git@github.com:QualityMermaid/TechEducationClone.git (make sure the link in github is the right code version. in this case its SSH)

### VSCode 

#### Commands
- ! (when using a blank html file can use ! to autofill in VSCode
- command+s (saves file. if the circle is white it means its not saved!)
- git status (will tell you the status of the file, red means untracked files)
- git add . (stages the enviroment)
- git commit -m "XXX"(add a message in the XXX for why you are commiting the code)
